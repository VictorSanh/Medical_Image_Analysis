MVA - Medical Image Analysis - Interactive Segmentation Project

The project is mainly based on the paper "Spatially varying color distributions for interacive multilabel segmentation" (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22908123) from Nieuwenuis C. and Cremers D. 

The implementation is based on the code furnished along with the paper. We introduced some changes in order to perform specific experiments. 

Experimentation report is available in French.
