#### General program parameters
# IMAGEFILE: can be all image formats handled by cimg, images must be 
# normalized to the range [0,255]
#
# SCRIBBLEFILE: (optional) file containing scribbles in the format 
# -1: pixels not contained in a scribble
# 0 - n: pixels contained in regions 0 to n
# If no scribble file is indicated then the program will run interactively,
# otherwise the scribbles are read from the indicated file
#
# To draw a scribble: draw scribble using the mouse, to assign it to a region label press
# the number of the region (between 0 and 9) on the keyboard, maximum number of
# regions supported is 10 (see variable MAXNREGIONS in cudaOptimization.cu)
#
# RESULTSFOLDER: folder so save all results to, i.e. the computed data term,
# the scribble file and the optimization result

#### Parameters for spatially varying color Parzen dataterm 
# based on paper Nieuwenhuis and Cremers, Spatially Varying Color Models for 
# Interactive Segmentation, PAMI 2013 (CITE this paper if using the color model 
# in this code)
#
# COLORVARIANCE: variance of Gaussian for color component in Parzen density, 
# rho in the paper, we normalize images to the range [0,..,255]
#
# SCRIBBLEDISTANCEFACTOR: variance of spatial component in the Parzen density is 
# multiplied by this factor, alpha, in the paper, must be 5 or larger for images 
# of range [0,..,255] to avoid artefacts due to spatial variances close to 0, set 
# to 1000 for turning spatial component off and having purely color based 
# likelihood
#
#### Parameters for drawing scribbles
# BRUSHSIZE: determines the size of brush for drawing scribbles 
#
# BRUSHDENSITY: ]0,1] determines the ratio of points in the scribble that are actually 
# used to compute the data term to save run time and memory, 1 means that all points 
# are used having a dense scribble, small ratios indicate scribbles of low density

#### Parameters for optimization methods 
# The two implemented optimization methods are compared in the paper Nieuwenhuis, 
# Töppe and Cremers, A Survey and Comparison of Discrete and Continuous Multilabel 
# Approaches for the Potts Model, IJCV 2013 (CITE this paper together with the 
# corresponding optimization paper if using the optimization routines in this code)
#
# OPTIMIZATIONMETHOD: "zach" or "chambolle"
# "zach" is based on the paper C. Zach, D. Gallup, J. Frahm and M. Niethammer, 
# Fast global labeling for realtime stereo using multiple plane sweeps, Vision, 
# Modeling and Visualization Workshop (VMV), 2008
# "chambolle" is based on the paper A. Chambolle, D. Cremers, T. Pock, A Convex 
# Approach to Minimal Partitions, SIAM Journal on Imaging Sciences, 2012
#
# SMOOTHNESSWEIGHT: weighting for regularizer for balancing data term and 
# regularization
#
# NUMSTEPS: number of iterations used in the optimization procedure
#
# DEBUGOUTPUT: "true" prints debug information on the screen during optimization
# "false" does not print debug information
#
# OUTPUTEVERYNSTEPS: step interval for printing debug information
